update art set notes = "A lot of people seem to cast doubt on the provenance of this painting. However it's my understanding that the central figures in the painting were painted by Rubens on paper, possibly as a study for his 'Virgin and Child with St Elizabeth and St John' (on display at the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona). This was later transferred to canvas and the background was completed by another artist." where artid = 2
