L'Assunta,Assumption of the Madonna,Titian,Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari,"This masterpiece was commissioned when Titian was only 28. It is thought to be the largest altarpiece in Venice and was returned to the Frari after World War One - it had been on display in a specially built room of the Accademia for some time. The painting is divided in three, with the apostles, modelled after local fishermen, depicted in the lowest layer painted in colder tones, with Mary depicted in warmer tones in the centre of the picture, and God emerging from the brightness of the heavens at the top. This dramatic painting caused some controversy at the time, although it is now widely recognised as a masterpiece. Oscar Wilde called it ""Certainly the best picture in Italy"" in 1875 when it was still in the Accademia. "

,Virgin and Child with the little St John,Peter Paul Rubens,Santa Maria del Giglio,"A lot of people seem to cast doubt on the provenance of this painting. However it's my understanding that the central figures in the painting were painted by Rubens on paper, possibly as a study for his 'Virgin and Child with St Elizabeth and St John' (on display at the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona). This was later transferred to canvas and the background was completed by another artist. "
